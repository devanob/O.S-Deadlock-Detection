# O.S-Deadlock-Detection
This outlines the design and development of the Implementation for the RAG based Deadlock Detection algorithm using the multiple processess. The program was written in C++. The program uses multi-processes to check whether the trains(processes) are stuck in a deadlock(multiple processes trying to access the cpu resourses at the same time). The program involves the use of semaphores(locks) to protect the processes so that no other process can try to alter the resourse managment.
